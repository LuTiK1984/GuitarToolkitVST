# Changelog

All notable changes to GuitarToolkit are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added ML Trainer model comparison, evaluation history, and a wider full checkpoint prompt suite for more objective model selection.
- Added a mood-targeted synthetic dataset profile and a dataset file picker in ML Trainer for focused mood fine-tuning.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added diverse progression dataset generation profiles, checkpoint diversity evaluation prompts, and label smoothing support for the next Inspiration Engine training passes.
- Added Inspiration Engine playback controls for tempo, volume, and looped audition playback.
- Added checkpoint evaluation summaries by style, mode, and mood, plus explicit training-device logging for GPU training checks.
- Added a standalone WinForms ML Trainer utility for dataset generation, training runs, checkpoint inspection, ONNX export/install, and the future melody Transformer workflow.
- Added in-epoch training progress output and clearer ML Trainer labels/tooltips for optimizer reset, CPU mode, learning rate, and label smoothing.
- Added model quality scores for diversity, confidence balance, musical fit, mood fit, style fit, and overall checkpoint comparison in the ML Trainer.
- Added the ML Trainer as a separate release archive in the release build script.

### Fixed

- Fixed progression-model label smoothing so loss is computed only across valid output tokens instead of masked vocabulary entries.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added maintainer documentation for the Inspiration Engine model contract, runtime model location, vocabulary shape, and training/export workflow.
- Added the first ML tooling layer for `ProgressionNextTokenModel`: stable vocabulary, sample JSONL dataset, GRU/LSTM training script, ONNX export script, and local artifact ignores.
- Added a 5,000-example synthetic progression dataset, dataset validator, checkpoint inspector, output-token masking, validation metrics, and a verified first local GRU training/export pass.
- Added resumable progression-model training with optimizer-state checkpoints, `best_model.pt`, metrics history, and optional periodic checkpoint snapshots.
- Expanded the synthetic progression generator with balanced context coverage, richer harmonic templates, cadences, substitutions, and mood-aware variation for the next training passes.
- Added ONNX Runtime inference for the Inspiration Engine progression model and a helper script for installing freshly exported models into the app runtime folder.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added a desktop custom title bar using WPF `WindowChrome`, with custom minimize, maximize, and close controls.
- Added a Settings tab with theme controls and a language-selection placeholder.

### Fixed

- Fixed a startup crash in the first light-theme mapper caused by duplicate reverse color mappings.
- Fixed custom title-bar maximize glyph encoding and enlarged the window-control icons.
- Restored custom title-bar hover hit testing for minimize, maximize, and close buttons.
- Fixed sidebar tab text encoding and protected selected-tab highlighting from global theme remapping.
- Replaced the fragile global element recoloring pass with resource-only theme application so dark theme keeps the original UI colors.
- Moved custom title-bar dragging out of the `WindowChrome` caption area so window-control hover states remain interactive.
- Applied theme resources across the shared tabs instead of limiting the light/dark switch to the Settings surface.
- Rebuilt the About tab with theme-aware resources and clean text encoding.
- Applied theme resources directly to each tab view so unselected tabs also pick up the active palette when opened.
- Added a narrow legacy-color remap for code-created controls, diagrams, beat indicators, tuner string cards, and other non-XAML brushes.
- Made the custom desktop title bar use the active dark/light palette so the light theme also changes the window frame.
- Made code-created Interval Trainer, Scales, Progressions, and Circle of Fifths controls redraw from the active theme palette.
- Polished light-theme tuner, metronome, chord, scale, and interval details before the 1.5 release pass.
- Refined the chord header alignment, fret-number spacing, current-progression outline, and theme-aware window frame styling.
- Softened the light-theme window frame and removed the duplicate centered title-bar label.
- Fixed custom maximized desktop windows so they respect the Windows taskbar work area.

### Changed

- Added a saved light theme option that keeps the main purple identity and accent color while remapping the interface to a lighter palette.
- Restyled the desktop custom title bar toward a glassy purple frame with soft highlights and rounded window controls.
- Reworked theme application toward explicit dark/light resource palettes instead of relying on fragile reverse color inference.
- Converted the host sidebar and settings surface to dynamic theme resources for a more predictable dark/light split.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Tabs file selection now uses one explicit source selector and one file selector instead of parallel library/recent/favorites lists.
- Removed the non-working visual sync control from the Tabs toolbar.
- Updated Tabs checkbox and slider styling to better match the dark purple theme.
- Refined the Tabs toolbar toward a compact 28px control rhythm, moved auto-follow next to track mute/solo, and improved the collapsed-window layout.
- Normalized Tabs toolbar spacing around a tighter 26px control size and lowered compact-window notation scale to show more usable tab area.
- Fine-tuned Tabs auto-follow and speed row vertical alignment for the compact toolbar layout.
- Nudged the Tabs speed controls down slightly to balance the lower toolbar spacing.
- Moved the Tabs auto-follow toggle beside the speed controls for a steadier compact layout.
- Rebuilt the Tabs speed-control row with fixed grid spacing to match the target compact toolbar layout.
- Equalized speed-row gaps and rounded the speed percentage field to match neighboring controls.
- Shifted the Tabs file controls right to balance compact-window side padding and reduce over-wide fullscreen file selectors.
- Redesigned the Circle of Fifths tab with the compact dark panel style established by the Tabs redesign.
- Enlarged Circle of Fifths note nodes and unified selection color: green for the selected key, purple for the key notes list.
- Added purple Circle of Fifths highlights for diatonic major and minor chord nodes around the selected key.
- Fixed Circle of Fifths diatonic highlighting for flat major keys such as Db, Ab, Eb, and Bb.
- Increased all Circle of Fifths note nodes for stronger readability.
- Redesigned the Progressions tab around a compact builder layout with separated built-in and saved presets.
- Progression preset saving now requires an explicit name and updates same-named saved presets instead of creating endless defaults.
- Styled Progressions combo box, slider, and loop checkbox to match the redesigned Tabs controls.
- Reworked the Progressions top toolbar into two rows so mode and loop controls remain visible in compact windows.
- Aligned the Progressions mode selector to the left and replaced preset button clouds with built-in and saved preset dropdowns.
- Redesigned the Interval Trainer tab with the same compact dark panel style, clearer answer grid, and stronger result highlighting.
- Redesigned the Scales tab with compact controls, info panels, and a controlled-height fretboard instead of the old oversized layout.
- Added the 17th-fret scale marker and redesigned the Chords tab with compact panels, cleaner filters, and a refreshed diagram area.
- Fixed a Chords filter crash, stabilized left navigation hover highlighting, and guarded Tabs track rendering/playback-mode errors.
- Quarantined tab files that fail during alphaTab import and documented the known GP4 import crash.
- Redesigned the Metronome tab with compact controls, animated pendulum feedback, beat indicators, and quick tempo presets.
- Fixed the Metronome pendulum so the rod and bob swing together from the same pivot.
- Centered the Metronome BPM label under the tempo number and redesigned the Tuner tab with compact panels, styled controls, and local input-device selection.
- Moved desktop input-device selection from the global header into the Tuner tab.
- Recentered the Tuner needle layout, stacked the detected note above the cents gauge, and normalized string cards into an even six-column row.
- Fixed Tuner text encoding, enlarged the frequency readout, centered the pitch display vertically, and removed note-label fade jitter.
- Normalized Chords type selector buttons to a fixed width so every chord type has the same visual size.
